# Nobel Laureates Web Scraper

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that scrapes data about Nobel laureates from the Wikipedia page "List of Nobel laureates".

## Files in this Repository

*   **`List of Nobel laureates-Web Scrapping.ipynb`**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to scrape the Nobel laureate data from Wikipedia. It includes two different methods for scraping and saving the data.
*   **`List of Nobel laureates.csv`**: This CSV file is generated by the first web scraping method in the notebook. It uses `csv.DictWriter` and populates missing fields with "—".
*   **`List of Nobel laureates2.csv`**: This CSV file is generated by the second web scraping method in the notebook. This version is created by manually writing to the file. Note that this file may contain `NaN` values for some missing data, particularly in the 'Economics' column for earlier years when the prize was not awarded.

## How to Run the Code

To run the web scraping notebook, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

*   requests
*   pandas
*   beautifulsoup4

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Jupyter Notebook `List of Nobel laureates-Web Scrapping.ipynb` using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
jupyter lab "List of Nobel laureates-Web Scrapping.ipynb"
# or
jupyter notebook "List of Nobel laureates-Web Scrapping.ipynb"
```

Running the cells in the notebook will execute the web scraping process and generate/overwrite the `.csv` files.

## Data Scraped

The script scrapes the following information for each Nobel laureate entry:

*   **Year**: The year the Nobel Prize was awarded.
*   **Physics**: The laureate(s) for the Physics prize.
*   **Chemistry**: The laureate(s) for the Chemistry prize.
*   **Physiology or Medicine**: The laureate(s) for the Physiology or Medicine prize.
*   **Literature**: The laureate(s) for the Literature prize.
*   **Peace**: The laureate(s) for the Peace prize.
*   **Economics**: The laureate(s) for the Economics prize (officially The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel). Fields will show "—" or potentially `NaN` if the prize was not awarded in that year or category.

## Potential Improvements & Known Issues

*   **Data Cleaning**: The scraped data for laureates might include multiple names in a single string (e.g., "Name1;Name2"). Further data cleaning could split these into individual entries or a more structured format if needed for analysis.
*   **Error Handling**: The current script has basic error handling. More robust error handling could be added (e.g., for network issues or changes in the Wikipedia page structure).
*   **`List of Nobel laureates2.csv` Inconsistencies**: As mentioned, `List of Nobel laureates2.csv` is generated by a slightly different method and might show `NaN` for missing 'Economics' data, unlike `List of Nobel laureates.csv` which uses "—". This is due to the different ways the CSVs are generated in the notebook. The first method (producing `List of Nobel laureates.csv`) is generally more consistent in handling missing values.
*   **Alternative Output Formats**: The script could be extended to save data in other formats like JSON or directly to a database.
